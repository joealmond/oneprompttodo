# Know-How: Project Knowledge Base

This folder contains **lessons learned** — things we discovered while building the project that aren't obvious from the code alone.

## How It Works

Each file is a short (max 30 lines) lesson about something we learned. Over time, this folder becomes the project's institutional knowledge — making every AI session smarter because it can read past discoveries.

## When To Add

Add a know-how entry when you:
- Discovered a non-obvious gotcha or workaround
- Made a technology choice and want to remember why
- Found that a common approach doesn't work in this project
- Learned something that would save future-you (or future-AI) time

## Naming Convention

`topic-name.md` — prefix with technology name if specific:
- `convex-aggregate-counts.md`
- `tanstack-ssr-gotchas.md`  
- `tailwind-v4-dark-mode.md`
- `why-we-chose-better-auth.md`

## Template

Use the `learn` skill to create entries, or follow this format:

```markdown
# Title

**Learned:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** What we were working on

## The Problem
What went wrong or was confusing.

## The Solution
The right approach.

## Key Takeaway
One sentence for future reference.
```
