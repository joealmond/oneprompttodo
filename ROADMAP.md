# Roadmap

Future ideas and non-actionable plans. When something here becomes actionable, create a GitHub Issue for it.

## Ideas

- MCP server for project management (read/create issues, check PR status)
- `llms.txt` at project root for machine-readable project index
- Obsidian vault symlinks for visual knowledge browsing
- Organization-level shared instructions via `.github-private` repo
- GitHub Actions workflow for auto-publishing docs
- `/status` prompt that summarizes project state (open issues, recent changelog, PRs)
