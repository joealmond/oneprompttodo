# Documentation Standards

When editing files in `docs/`:

- Keep files focused — one topic per file
- Use clear headings and short paragraphs
- Include dates on entries (CHANGELOG, ADRs, know-how)
- Use relative links between docs
- CHANGELOG entries follow: `### [Type]: Title (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- ADRs follow the template in `.github/skills/adr/template.md`
- Know-how entries are max 30 lines — be concise
- Never delete — mark as deprecated with a note
